        understand what kind of graph, any given graph is. Weather it is:
        directed or undirected
        weighted or unweighted
        cyclic or acyclic
        connected or disconnected

        know if a given graph is a single graph or multiple graphs
        know how many components are there in a given graph

        understand about adjacencyMatrix and adjacencyList
